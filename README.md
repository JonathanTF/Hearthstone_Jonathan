# Hearthstone_Jonathan
My notebook for a Hearthstone data science project.
Goal is to uncover what makes a deck of cards in hearthstone popular using the History of Hearthstone dataset on Kaggle. The project tries to predict wether a given deck will be popular or not.
Data preprocessing, categorization, regression and classification testing.
